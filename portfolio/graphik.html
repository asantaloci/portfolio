      <p class="col-md-7">
This is my personal entrepreneurial project to help connect local artists with consumers, because of the lack of exposure in my college town.

      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
      I decided to create website that is tailored to customers that would want to purchase local artist printed apparel, as well as have the option to apply for artist submissions. This website and business is still a work in progress, but I will keep adding to it.

      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">My Process</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
  The first step in the process of creating anything is identifying the problem to solve. In my and many of my friends' cases, this was the lack of exposure of our artistic work into our local communities. I go to college in UNC, and unfortunately there are scarce opportunities for artists to present their work and sell them in a space where people want to purchase locally made art. I wanted to provide a way for artists to get exposure for their work in a more popular form for our communities to purchase: apparel. Everyone buys clothes out of necessity, which is where the idea of making locally created artwork presented on apparel emerged.

    </div>
    <div class="row section blueberry paddings">
      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Research</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
        Once I found a problem and a potential solution to solve the problem, I began exploring similar ideas through online research. There were many companies that already solved similar problems like Redbubble, but the one aspect that was missing was the local-ness and the focus of the artist, rather than product. So I began the process of creating a plan of how this would work, how to style the business online drawing inspiration from trends on instagram, pinterest, and other websites, and outlined the goals I wanted to accomplish with the company.I played around with the lettering and the shapes around the photos, but I kept the focus on the outfits and placed the descriptions of the items next to the images. I selected images not only because of their fit to Urban's theme (since it is their own clothing I'm presenting), but also to showcase an example of what a revamped lookbook could potentially look like in the future.

          - There were companies online that provided similar solutions for artists, but there was a lack of locality
        <br />  <br />- There wasn't a large push for local art exposure in Chapel Hill

      <p class="col-md-6">
        To solve this problem, I am creating a brand based on the designs of local artists. The plan is to select a few artists in my community considering the cohesiveness of style and the brand as a whole, let them choose the artwork they wanted to be featured on the apparel, and create a limited quantity of shirts, bags, and more based on demand. For every purchase made, part of the proceeds goes to the artist, as if they were auctioning off an art piece. From there, I would cycle through more designs and artists to grow exposure of not only the artists and their work, but the brand itself. To showcase the process, I created a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a trendy style to attract a young adult audience.</p>

      This was a fun project that allowed me to analyze a problem in my local campus community and drove me to create a potential solution. I hope that I can continue the project in the future, but for now it is on hiatus due to other priorities with school/work. Either way, this was a great experience for me to develop a plan for a company for a specific need!</p>
