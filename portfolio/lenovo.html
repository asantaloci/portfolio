      <p class="col-md-7">
I am created multiple VR experiences in my Media and Journalism class in a collaboration with Lenovo to portray the message of Lenovo's smarter, more inclusive technology. My role requires me to use Unreal Engine, Adobe Suite, and Blender to create an interactive data center, and an interactive 3D photography experience for the Nepalese holy site Swayambhunath. </p>

        <p class="accent-text">
        In order to be successful, I had to learn:
        <br /><br />
        - Unreal Engine (Blueprint)<br /><br />
      - How to model/edit premade builds<br /><br />
    - The best way to tie all the experiences of the class together in a main menu
  </p>

    <div class="row kanari" style="padding: 2em 5em;">
    <p>
  The three different experiences I had to navigate to were a rural farmland exposing new technology that can be used to help monitor crops, a rainforest where the
  user could assist in finding snakes to gather venom to find cures to disease, and the Nepalese holy site Swayambhunath to capture the religious history of the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
Since our whole class had a part in creating this whole experience, we decided the best way to connect all of these themes would be through a Lenovo database, since these experiences
were powered by Lenovo technology. In terms of how I designed the data center, I found a model online that best fit what we envisioned, and I edited it to fit the three navigation screens.
I also had to integrate a VR persona into the project that had a pointer to select which experience they would like to go into, shown below in my video demo.

  <h3 class="col-md-6 portfolio-text">Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
  <p class="col-md-6">
This project allowed me to learn a lot in a matter of a few months - I collaborated and presented ideas to Lenovo representatives, became the sole VR developer in charge of combining all of the Lenovo experiences in a menu, and learned Unreal Engine and other VR rendering skills as I worked on the project.
I knew Unity through my previous projects, but this was my first time ever using Unreal and creating something that is functional and used in a pretty big project.

<br />
<br />
In terms of the struggles I and the rest of my class faced, this project was interrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, making it a lot harder to communicate with my peers and combine all of our projects together.
We ended up having to make all of our experiences separate, to eventually combine later. It was also a challenge to learn Unreal on my own, but luckily I had some calls with some assistants in the Media and Joounralism lab that could walk me through technical difficulties.
Overall, it was a really good experience that could have definitely been executed better if not for the challenging times that we faced midway through our class.
