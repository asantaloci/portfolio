      <h3 class="portfolio-text">Objective</h3>
      <p class="">
My goal by making this website was to be able to showcase my UX/UI, web development, and coding capabilities in one go. I was inclined to make my website from scratch because
this was the best way to display my creativity and technical abilities without the bounds of specific company color schemes, UI kits, etc.

      <h3 class="portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="">
        It would've been a lot easier to just pay for a service like <i>SquareSpace</i>
        or <i>Wordpress</i> to make my website but being a college student, I have limited funds, thus hosting my site for free on <i>GitHub</i> was optimal!

                  <p class="">
                  I really wanted this website to be:
                  <br /><br />
                  - aesthetic
                <br />
                  - easy to use, but slightly unconventional
                  <br />
                  - present my work in a creative light
                  <br />
                  - be something that I was genuinely proud and happy of
                  <br />
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div class="row section paddings">
                  <h3 class="col-md-6 portfolio-text">Style Choices</h3>
                  <p class="col-md-6">
                  Why did I choose the colors and designs that I chose? To be frank, I honestly just liked the colors. But I wanted to keep in mind that
                  when I designed how the fonts would be placed on the page, including how big and how contrasting the items on the page, the elements would need to fit accessibility standards.
                  I used this application called <i>Sim Daltonism</i>, a colorblindness simulator that would allow me to go through each of my pages and view what my site would look like from different
                  types of colorblindness. I researched a lot about accessibility in computer science (specifically videogames) and I make sure that I try my best to make what I create as accessible as I can with my current knowledge.
                  Thus, I made sure the contrast between fonts and the background, although aesthetic, they were legible too. I also wanted to make links and other varying texts visibly different that way all users can distinguish links.
<br /><br />
                  For the alignment of the text and certain images, I wanted more general, subheader content to be on the left, and details to be on the right. I wanted to section off the information vertically for header/description content, as well as horizontally per each topic.
                  </p>

      <h3 class="col-md-6 portfolio-text">Conclusion and Next Steps</h3>
      <p class="col-md-6">
      This is the first portfolio that I've made that I am genuinely excited to show to people! Although I need to make a lot of revisions as my experience changes or if I have something interesting to add to one of my old portfolio items,
    that's what makes the website enjoyable to work on. I like being able to work towards a goal that continues to change, while having fun formatting and finding better ways to design the website along the way. Keep checking out my portfolio for more updates as I continue to
   create new things!  </div>
