      <p class="col-md-7">
        For our web development class final, we decided to create a social media app for travelers and those who are interested in getting ideas for traveling.
        We had to learn and incorporate the class' backend provided, as well as an API for our project. <i>Aug 24th Update: We plan on revamping the app
          by using Firebase in order for the app to be live and on the web, so look out for updates!</i>
      </p>

    <div class="row section">
      <div class="col-sm-5 col-xs-12 featured-project lavender" style="height:100vh;">

        <p class="accent-text">
          In order to be successful, I had to learn:
          <br /><br />
          - How to run/integrate the backend<br /><br />
          - What UI we wanted to provide<br /><br />
          - Which APIs we wanted to include that would make sense for the app
        </p>

      <p>
        The premise of our application was to have a public feed where anyone in the world could post about a trip that they went on, where users can save trips by liking the post so it can be viewed in their own saved trips library.
        The three main pages that we had to create were the login page, the feed page, and the profile page. </p>
      <p>

        The login page would allow the user to either log in with existing credentials, create a new user, or continue as a guest. The user would not be able to post if they continued as a guest, but they could still see the live newsfeed.
        Having a login would allow you to save trips onto your profile page and post on the feed.


      </p>
      <p>
        To post, the user would have to input information such as where they were from and where they were going, as well as a status update about what they did or any recommendations they had. This was where the Google Maps API search was
        integrated,
        so the user could enter a location and the app would show it on the map itself.


      </p>

      <p>
        My partner and I spent 2-3 days before the showcase (as most college students that procrastinate do) to go over the documentation of the backend, and to set up a way for the
        backend to interact with the front end. My partner handled connecting the documented backend and making sure it worked, while I created the html/css/javascript, and API integrations so that
        the data that was inputted in the app would appear on the app itself.

      <p class="col-md-6">
        Overall, this was a project that my partner and I were pretty passionate about, since we both really enjoy traveling and finding things to do. This has become more of a passion project now because we would like to upgrade what we currently
        have and make it a fully functional app.
