          Duration: +5 Months

      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Objective</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
Since Cisco relies on distributors to buy and sell their products to customers, it is important that the experience Cisco's distributors and the employees navigating the same interfaces
when recording point of sales, location information, and more are easy to use. Unfortunately, this was not the case when I entered the internship. There was not a streamlined approach
for users to take for any of the 4-5 applications they normally used, and it was even hard to keep track of where all the applications were in the first place (they were all notified by email, and none of the applications were in a common central place).
So, I decided to take a crack at consolidating the applications, and making the experience easier for all stakeholders involved, without losing valuable information and processes.

      </p>


    </div>
    <div class="row section paddings">
      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Another Opportunity</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
      Along the way of my process, I was given another task on a different team to create a full portfolio of applications for the transition out of Cisco's current HR model. This meant splitting my worktime, and
      since this new team/project was meant to be my new priority, I had to be able to complete what I set to do with my initial Distribution project, as well as begin a new workload of web development and wireframing for the HR reconstruction.

            </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row section paddings">
      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
        Thus, my solution for my summer internship was to create a consolidated page for all the distribution apps to be hosted on, and to complete the urgent portfolio of HR tools with my different teams.
        I was the only design/UX tech intern within all of my teams, so this would also be a challenge, as people were reliant on me to know what was best in a UX standpoint.
        <br><br><i>*Disclaimer*</i> Most of the work I did with Cisco is confidential, so I will be describing some interfaces vaguely/showcasing problem areas the best I can!

                  <p class="col-md-6">
                    My main observations on the current interface of one of the main distributor apps I focused on:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    - There is very outdated styling/sizing throughout all applications (not up to date with the Cisco UI Kit)
                    <br /><br />
                    - The navigation itself was confusing, especially when there were two nav menus on the same screen
                    <br /><br />
                    - Important data was presented in a cluttered table format, making it harder for users to navigate the information efficiently
                    <br /><br />
                    - There were little to no instructions on the pages, making it difficult for new users to understand where to go unless taught step by step
                    <br /><br />

    Common responses about participant opinions on purchasing apps similar to <i>Starbucks</i> were that benefits include a <b>reward points and digital payment system</b> and <b>quicker pick-up</b>, avoiding lines.

    57.1% of participants were interested in seeing a similar application implemented for The Meantime.</p>

                    <br>
                    The Meantime does not have enough real estate to employ a second ipad, and they don’t have the capital to sponsor an entire app design.

                    Includes tipping options:
                    <br>
                    A year after the Meantime opened, the company shifted to a cashless business products.  Though this gave the company a larger sense of security, it negatively impacted baristas, as customers were no longer able to give their spare change to baristas as tips.  Interested stakeholders revealed that they did not want a new system to further impact barista tips, an important portion of their income.

                    Imposes Time Limit:
                    <br>
                    Stakeholder interviews revealed that espresso drinks begin to lose their quality after 10 minutes.  The company wanted to ensure that remote ordering, and the late pickups that could result from it, would not negatively impact the company’s brand and perceived quality.

                  <h3 class="col-md-6 portfolio-text">Interface Research</h3>
                  <p class="col-md-6">
                    After researching current online ordering platforms such as <i>Starbucks</i> or <i>Dunkin' Donuts</i>, we decided the elements we wanted to include were the ability to create an account with a card for fast ordering, order specific menu items online and schedule a pickup time, and have a reward system based on how many times users use the app to order.
Obviously the objective of the new system involves making rush hour times easier to manage for both baristas and customers. However it is very important that the community and culture of The Meantime be maintained, after all The Meantime is not a commercial giant. The application we design and develop should take into consideration its users and their motivations for purchasing at the café. So based on customers surveys and interviews it becomes clear what people want to see in the application. It should also be easily implemented because of the limited resources that The Meantime has as a student run non-profit.

For the interface design, I wanted the layout and color scheme to be similar to the main Meantime Coffee Co. website, with its warm hues and colorful hero image.
I also tried to make the design as simplistic as possible, only focusing on what truly needed to be included: a sign in option (member or guest), a rewards page, a menu to select an order, a page to determine a pickup time, and a checkout screen.
        </p>
        <p>
    The navigations and its colors allows the user to feel more relaxed and easy-going while using the app.

      <p class="col-md-6">
        As my first team project, this experience exposed me to project management and leadership: we started from vague ideas which transformed to a practical product by using my knowledge of problem-solving to real life situations in a rigorous manner.

The project recieved genuine interest from the Meantime for continued development in the future. Through our efforts, we found a real problem that an on-campus, student-run venture faces and designed a viable solution. We are exceptionally lucky to present an offering that could increase the operational efficiency, serving capacity, and quality of an organization that provides a tremendous value to the University, its students, and the Carolina community as a whole. We put a great deal of time and effort into this project knowing its potential to improve the Meantime’s social value proposition.
<br /> <br />With future iterations, we hope that this solution can increase student scholarships, enable greater learning and compensation for all Meantime employees, create a better platform for Carolina-centric student ventures, and fulfill the great need for excellent, empowering coffee experiences at UNC. </p>
