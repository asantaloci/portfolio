      class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Objective</h3> <p class="col-md-7"> Since
      Cisco relies on distributors to buy and sell their products to customers,
      it is important that the experience Cisco's distributors and the employees
      navigating the same interfaces when recording point of sales, location
      information, and more are easy to use. Unfortunately, this was not the
      case when I entered the internship. There was not a streamlined approach
      for users to take for any of the 4-5 applications they normally used, and
      it was even hard to keep track of where all the applications were in the
      first place (they were all notified by email, and none of the applications
      were in a common central place). So, I decided to take a crack at
      consolidating the applications, and making the experience easier for all
      stakeholders involved, without losing valuable information and processes.

      </p>

    </div> <div class="row section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-5
    portfolio-text">Another Opportunity</h3> <p class="col-md-7"> Along the way
    of my process, I was given another task on a different team to create a full
    portfolio of applications for the transition out of Cisco's current HR
    model. This meant splitting my worktime, and since this new team/project was
    meant to be my new priority, I had to be able to complete what I set to do
    with my initial Distribution project, as well as begin a new workload of web
    development and wireframing for the HR reconstruction.

            </p> </div>

    <div class="row section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-5
    portfolio-text">Solution</h3> <p class="col-md-7"> Thus, my solution for my
    summer internship was to create a consolidated page for all the distribution
    apps to be hosted on, and to complete the urgent portfolio of HR tools with
    my different teams. I was the only design/UX tech intern within all of my
    teams, so this would also be a challenge, as people were reliant on me to
    know what was best in a UX standpoint. <br><br><i>*Disclaimer*</i> Most of
    the work I did with Cisco is confidential, so I will be describing some
    interfaces vaguely/showcasing problem areas the best I can! </p> </div> <div

    <div class="row blueberry section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-6
    portfolio-text">Initial Status</h3> <p class="col-md-6"> Before I entered my
    internship with Cisco, there was no sort of consolidation of these 4-5
    different apps. This meant that these applications were only viewed through
    email links, which is not very accessible. This is why I was tasked to
    create a new interface for all of these apps to be presented, and have the
    apps be dynamic based on the type of role each user had. </p> </div> <div
    class="row blueberry section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-6
    portfolio-text">Draft Interface</h3> <p class="col-md-6"> To start
    somewhere, they gave me a draft of what they pictured for the page to look
    like: </p> </div> <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 blueberry"

    <div class="row blueberry section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-6
    portfolio-text">Fixes</h3> <p class="col-md-6"> There were a few things that
    I wanted to change and add to this current draft: <br /> <br /> - There was
    no need for a hero image, since it would distract from the main purpose of
    the page: the accessibility of the applications <br /><br /> - The
    notifications and release events sections of the page had the same
    information, meaning that it was mainly used for filler material, so I
    wanted to remove at least one of those sections or reorganize how
    notifications would be used <br /><br /> - There was no area for the user's
    metrics or alerts for the different applications, which could be useful so
    each user could have an idea of what tasks they need to get done <br /><br
    /> - The interface was not that outdated, but I still wanted to make some UI
    changes to make it more in sync with the rest of the applications <br /><br

    </div> <div class="row blueberry section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-6
    portfolio-text">My Thoughts</h3> <p class="col-md-6"> I think my new design
    is cleaner, and eliminates extra scrolling, and simplifies what needs to be
    present on the homepage. The hierarchy of the application makes sense, with
    the applications accessible as soon as you enter the page, as well as
    metrics to help users figure out what needs to be done. <br /> <br /> Having
    a new alerts button at the top will provide a more detailed idea of what
    things need to be done as well, and can redirect the user to different apps
    based on the alert message. As for the news section, since it does not take
    priority, having the button on the top right side of the screen allows it to
    not take up real estate, unless needed. <br /> <br /> Overall I think I made
    an effective homepage to house all of the different distributor
    applications, and give them visible metrics on their personal tasks that
    wasn't available before. </p>

    change, as well as my plan for consolidating all Distributor apps. </p>

                portfolio-text">Current App Observations</h3> <p
                class="col-md-6"> My main observations on the current interface
                of one of the main distributor apps I focused on: <br /> <br />
                - There is very outdated styling/sizing throughout all
                applications (not up to date with the Cisco UI Kit, since it was
                last updated in early 2000s) <br /><br /> - The navigation
                itself was confusing, especially when there were two nav menus
                on the same screen <br /><br /> - Important data was presented
                in a cluttered table format, making it harder for users to
                navigate the information efficiently <br /><br /> - There were
                little to no instructions on the pages, making it difficult for
                new users to understand where to go unless taught step by step
                <br /><br /> *A lo-fi version of the application is pictured
                below*

                <div class="row blueberry section paddings"> <h3 class="col-md-6
                portfolio-text">Filter Page Observations</h3> <p
                class="col-md-6"> When you click into any of the dropdown child
                pages from the main navigation, most if not all of these pages
                include a filter, an excel table with all transaction
                information, and some sort of action to take. <br /> <br />
                Since all of these pages were practically the same, I decided to
                consolidate all of these pages into one solid page per topic,
                lessening the amount of navigating action that the user would
                have to do, and eliminating the repetition. I also wanted to
                update the look of the filter so it wouldn't take up almost the
                entire screen, since users of the app would only fill out 1-2 of
                these filter specifications. The excel table would also be
                changed because of the intense amount of horizontal scrolling,
                and I knew there would be a better way to present and take
                action on that information. *A lo-fi version of the application
                is pictured below*

                portfolio-text">My Fixes</h3> <p class="col-md-6"> Along with
                the changes I mentioned above, in my version of one of the
                consolidated pages, I have the table of information with only
                relevant data, without the need for horizontal scrolling. I also
                added an option to sort based on all, error (transactions that
                need to be fixed), and expired. Also in the table, there is an
                option to apply more filters if the user selects the "filter"
                button, which will expand a small section that has different
                filter specifications. <br /><br /> In terms of actions, for the
                specific example I have pictured, "Extend Expiration" and "New
                Submission" were the only subpages that had a different page
                with distinguished actions, so I decided to have them be their
                own separate buttons that would create a popup once clicked.

              /> Coming Soon: This section will vaguely cover (due to the very
              sensitive content of these applications) the HR applications I
              created and continue to create as of Fall 2020. </p> </div> <div

              portfolio-text">Conclusion and Next Steps</h3> <p
              class="col-md-6"> This was my very first internship in a large
              tech company, and overall it was very impactful to my experience
              and my understanding of how UX works in certain environments. I
              definitely did not have as much time to go into the research and
              interview aspects of UX, and I was expected to crank out
              wireframes over very short amounts of time, sometimes even less a
              night. However, I realized that due to the limited timeframe of
              the applications we were making in order to redesign all of HR, I
              understood that this was an uncommon practice at Cisco.
              Nonetheless, I learned to make quick decisions and create
              wireframes with purpose and functionality in mind, rather than
              aesthetics. I was also the only UX/design employee on my team,
              which meant that I had to reach out to others outside of my
              function in order to get a second opinion (but this was harder to
              do for the highly confidential apps that I worked on later). In
              the future, I'd like to work on more projects that allow me to
              experience the full process of how interfaces and experiences are
              made, possibly with a UX partner or group to bounce ideas off of,
              but I still think that this was a very valuable experience and
              gave me a look into the adult tech world. </p> </div>
