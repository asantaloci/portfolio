      <p class="col-md-7">
        Pearl Hacks is a women and non-binary hackathon open to undergraduates all across the country, located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

        Starting April 2018, my goal was to create a longlasting brand for the nationwide hackathon, while making sure the impact of the designs were inclusive and empowering for the participants, as well as the sponsors and mentors engaged in the
        event.

        Up until then, the branding for Pearl Hacks varied year to year, with different themes that never carried on to the next. This variance raised a problem of the lack of brand recognition and solid message conveyed of what Pearl Hacks was and
        represented.


      </p>

      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
        This objective meant tackling the design from the bottom up, starting from a wholistic goal of what the design would convey,
what color schemes to use to inspire inclusivity, what iconography or images to symbolize Pearl Hacks, and more. It also meant tying these values into an interface that would be not only user friendly, in a clean and common-sense layout, but empowering to the visitors and get them excited for the event.
This process took two years to build upon and edit, as my first year working on this had some issues that I solved in the next year).

      <p class="col-md-12">The new logo
        <br />
        <br />
One of the main tasks I had to work on in my first year was creating a logo that would represent Pearl Hacks in its years to come.

The main logo was designed to convey the fluidity of the field of computer science, and was shaped as a pearl to symbolize the hackathon’s name.

Here are a few drafts of the logo designs I created.

  The pink colors were shown to be more welcoming and friendly than cooler colors that I sampled. However, after feedback from a few directors, I decided to change to a more neutral color scheme for 2019-2020 to be carried forward for the next few years, to purple.

          <br />
          <br />
          An element that I did want to keep from previous years was the different themes that each year centered on. Although the logo I created would be consistent, having creative freedom to show the diversity and inclusion of Pearl Hacks every year seemed like an aspect that Pearl Hacks had within its design that was important to keep.

  Thus, I created graphics based on the inspiring historical figure Rosie the Riveter, a symbol for women and minority empowerment that was seen as a good figurehead for the 2018-2019 Pearl Hacks design center, with additions of circuit board elements to convey the technological aspect of Pearl Hacks. </p>

  <p class="col-md-6">
Overall, the designs were well received and successful in conveying the hackathon in an inclusive way. However, I learned in order to be fully inclusive to everyone participating in the hackathon, having a gender neutral color scheme would be something to improve on, especially since the color pink, although symbolizing approachability and friendliness, could come off as feminine as well, which does not represent the participants of Pearl Hacks fully. Thus, the following year, I decided to improve on this. </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    The purple was a necessary change in order to represent non-binary students at the hackathon and present a neutral branding scheme to create an inclusive environment.



I also tested the accessibility of the colors to make sure they were visible for low-vision users, using the application Sim Daltonism to test the different types of colorblindness and approve of the contrast of the colors.

        <br />
 Also for 2019-2020, I decided to create a strict color scheme and font selection for organizational and cohesive purposes. My style guide is below. I incorporated the same title font (Caviar Dreams) for “Pearl Hacks”, but decided to move towards a more legible font for the body of the rest of the text, being Proxima Nova.

      <p class="col-md-6">
        After two years of working on Pearl Hacks branding, I have definitely grown a lot from the experiences I’ve had. From very sudden and tight deadlines to artist’s block, I encountered a lot of challenges in making the designs for Pearl Hacks. I learned to work with a board of directors (which grew from 8-9 to 14 in the 2020 year!), and being the only design oriented director on the team, I had to make sure I was able to balance accessibility, vision, and aesthetics in order to make a successful product. I’ve received good feedback for 2020’s designs, especially with its color scheme, graphics, and website being inclusive and friendly to the participants and everyone involved in the hackathon.

      This year, I am an active mentor for the new Director of Design; helping with graphics, themes, and more. </p>
