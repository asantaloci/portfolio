      <p class="col-md-7">
The Meantime Coffee Co. is an sustainably-sourced coffee shop located in Chapel Hill that is always bustling with customers, especially during their rush hours. A team of students (including myself) decided to create a information system proposal for The Meantime to administer to increase workflow speed and increased profit, since they were losing a lot of customers due to crowded rush hours and no organized ordering system.

      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
        I had a successful proposal to integrate a mobile app in The Meantime Coffee Co.’s workflow to improve its productivity. I worked to define problems, conduct interviews for user input, and research technical data gathered from the workplace. Then, I analyzed this information and data to program the mobile app on their website. I developed user stories to show the purpose of the application from an average user’s perspective, created wireframes to illustrate the workflow of this process, and made a functioning mobile app to be presented to the managers of the coffee shop.

                    Our team conducted on-site observations to:

                    <br />
                    - <b>Finalize specific prine rush times during the day</b> (typically in the early afternoon)
                    <br /><br />
                    - <b>Observe how baristas handle the rush</b> (2 baristas, with delegated responsibilities)
                    <br /><br />
                    - <b>Oversee the ease of ordering</b> (the process involves an iPad with a ShopKeep Point of Sale App, with a simple card swiping payment process)
                    <br /><br />
                    - <b>Measure average wait times</b> (Using stopwatches, from a customer's entry into line until receipt of the order, we timed 3-4 minutes)
                    <br /><br />
                    - <b>Document spatial layout of the cafe</b> (drawn below)

    Common responses about participant opinions on purchasing apps similar to <i>Starbucks</i> were that benefits include a <b>reward points and digital payment system</b> and <b>quicker pick-up</b>, avoiding lines.

    57.1% of participants were interested in seeing a similar application implemented for The Meantime.</p>

                    Interfaces with current system:
                    <br>
                    The Meantime does not have enough real estate to employ a second ipad, and they don’t have the capital to sponsor an entire app design.

                    Includes tipping options:
                    <br>
                    A year after the Meantime opened, the company shifted to a cashless business products.  Though this gave the company a larger sense of security, it negatively impacted baristas, as customers were no longer able to give their spare change to baristas as tips.  Interested stakeholders revealed that they did not want a new system to further impact barista tips, an important portion of their income.

                    Imposes Time Limit:
                    <br>
                    Stakeholder interviews revealed that espresso drinks begin to lose their quality after 10 minutes.  The company wanted to ensure that remote ordering, and the late pickups that could result from it, would not negatively impact the company’s brand and perceived quality.

                  <h3 class="col-md-6 portfolio-text">Interface Research</h3>
                  <p class="col-md-6">
                    After researching current online ordering platforms such as <i>Starbucks</i> or <i>Dunkin' Donuts</i>, we decided the elements we wanted to include were the ability to create an account with a card for fast ordering, order specific menu items online and schedule a pickup time, and have a reward system based on how many times users use the app to order.
Obviously the objective of the new system involves making rush hour times easier to manage for both baristas and customers. However it is very important that the community and culture of The Meantime be maintained, after all The Meantime is not a commercial giant. The application we design and develop should take into consideration its users and their motivations for purchasing at the café. So based on customers surveys and interviews it becomes clear what people want to see in the application. It should also be easily implemented because of the limited resources that The Meantime has as a student run non-profit.

For the interface design, I wanted the layout and color scheme to be similar to the main Meantime Coffee Co. website, with its warm hues and colorful hero image.
I also tried to make the design as simplistic as possible, only focusing on what truly needed to be included: a sign in option (member or guest), a rewards page, a menu to select an order, a page to determine a pickup time, and a checkout screen.
        </p>
        <p>
    The navigations and its colors allows the user to feel more relaxed and easy-going while using the app.

      <p class="col-md-6">
        As my first team project, this experience exposed me to project management and leadership: we started from vague ideas which transformed to a practical product by using my knowledge of problem-solving to real life situations in a rigorous manner.

The project recieved genuine interest from the Meantime for continued development in the future. Through our efforts, we found a real problem that an on-campus, student-run venture faces and designed a viable solution. We are exceptionally lucky to present an offering that could increase the operational efficiency, serving capacity, and quality of an organization that provides a tremendous value to the University, its students, and the Carolina community as a whole. We put a great deal of time and effort into this project knowing its potential to improve the Meantime’s social value proposition.
<br /> <br />With future iterations, we hope that this solution can increase student scholarships, enable greater learning and compensation for all Meantime employees, create a better platform for Carolina-centric student ventures, and fulfill the great need for excellent, empowering coffee experiences at UNC. </p>
