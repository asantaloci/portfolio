      <p class="col-md-7">
        Our team had to create a <i>serious game</i>, or a game that served a greater educational, beneficial purpose besides entertainment. Our client
        wanted a game that would teach people how to cultivate good habits using the <a style="color: #A7314D;"href="https://woopmylife.org/en/home">WOOP model</a>.

    <div class="row section paddings">
      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
        To make the game come to life, we created a simulation type mobile app (available on Android devices) where the palyer chooses a pet/habit to take care of by doing in-game and out-of-game activities.
        By taking care of the pets or habits, the player is also taking steps in practicing their habits and training themselves to keep up those habits.
        My role in the project was the design architect, as well as the creator of all graphics in the game.

        <p class="accent-text">
          In order to be successful, I had to learn:
          <br /><br />
          - How Firebase worked, and how to connect our in-game actions to the database<br /><br />
          - How to code in Unity (C#)<br /><br />
          - The overall structure and experience that the user would go through

      <p>
        The premise of our application was to have a public feed where anyone in the world could post about a trip that they went on, where users can save trips by liking the post so it can be viewed in their own saved trips library.
        The three main pages that we had to create were the login page, the feed page, and the profile page. </p>
      <p>

        The login page would allow the user to either log in with existing credentials, create a new user, or continue as a guest. The user would not be able to post if they continued as a guest, but they could still see the live newsfeed.
        Having a login would allow you to save trips onto your profile page and post on the feed.


      </p>
      <p>
        To post, the user would have to input information such as where they were from and where they were going, as well as a status update about what they did or any recommendations they had. This was where the Google Maps API search was
        integrated,
        so the user could enter a location and the app would show it on the map itself.


      </p>

      <p>
        My partner and I spent 2-3 days before the showcase (as most college students that procrastinate do) to go over the documentation of the backend, and to set up a way for the
        backend to interact with the front end. My partner handled connecting the documented backend and making sure it worked, while I created the html/css/javascript, and API integrations so that
        the data that was inputted in the app would appear on the app itself.

      <p class="col-md-6">
        Overall, this was a project that my partner and I were pretty passionate about, since we both really enjoy traveling and finding things to do. This has become more of a passion project now because we would like to upgrade what we currently
        have and make it a fully functional app.
