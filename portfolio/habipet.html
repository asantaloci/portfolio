      <p class="col-md-7">
        Pearl Hacks is a women and non-binary hackathon open to undergraduates all across the country, located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

        Starting April 2018, my goal was to create a longlasting brand for the nationwide hackathon, while making sure the impact of the designs were inclusive and empowering for the participants, as well as the sponsors and mentors engaged in the
        event.

        Up until then, the branding for Pearl Hacks varied year to year, with different themes that never carried on to the next. This variance raised a problem of the lack of brand recognition and solid message conveyed of what Pearl Hacks was and
        represented.


      </p>

      <h3 class="col-md-5 portfolio-text">Solution</h3>
      <p class="col-md-7">
        This objective meant tackling the design from the bottom up, starting from a wholistic goal of what the design would convey,
        what color schemes to use to inspire inclusivity, what iconography or images to symbolize Pearl Hacks, and more. It also meant tying these values into an interface that would be not only user friendly, in a clean and common-sense layout, but
        empowering to the visitors and get them excited for the event.
        This process took two years to build upon and edit, as my first year working on this had some issues that I solved in the next year).

          In order to be successful, I had to learn:
          <br /><br />
          - How to run/integrate the backend<br /><br />
          - What UI we wanted to provide<br /><br />
          - Which APIs we wanted to include that would make sense for the app
        </p>

      <p>
        The premise of our application was to have a public feed where anyone in the world could post about a trip that they went on, where users can save trips by liking the post so it can be viewed in their own saved trips library.
        The three main pages that we had to create were the login page, the feed page, and the profile page. </p>
      <p>

        The login page would allow the user to either log in with existing credentials, create a new user, or continue as a guest. The user would not be able to post if they continued as a guest, but they could still see the live newsfeed.
        Having a login would allow you to save trips onto your profile page and post on the feed.


      </p>
      <p>
        To post, the user would have to input information such as where they were from and where they were going, as well as a status update about what they did or any recommendations they had. This was where the Google Maps API search was
        integrated,
        so the user could enter a location and the app would show it on the map itself.


      </p>

      <p>
        My partner and I spent 2-3 days before the showcase (as most college students that procrastinate do) to go over the documentation of the backend, and to set up a way for the
        backend to interact with the front end. My partner handled connecting the documented backend and making sure it worked, while I created the html/css/javascript, and API integrations so that
        the data that was inputted in the app would appear on the app itself.

      <p class="col-md-6">
        Overall, this was a project that my partner and I were pretty passionate about, since we both really enjoy traveling and finding things to do. This has become more of a passion project now because we would like to upgrade what we currently
        have and make it a fully functional app.
